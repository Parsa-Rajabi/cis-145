        <p>This is <br> a long paragraph <br> that I want to <br> break down into smaller pieces</p>
        <p>This is another new paragraph</p>

        <p>The following text was mentioned by Terry Fox's wikipedia page:</p>

        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Fox">
            Fox was a distance runner and basketball player for his Port Coquitlam high school, now named after him, and Simon Fraser University. His right leg was amputated in 1977 after he was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, though he continued to run using an artificial leg. He also played wheelchair basketball in Vancouver, winning three national championships.
