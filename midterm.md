## Exam Rules  

- You must complete the test BY YOURSELF (no friends, no tutors, no classmates, no humans - cats and dogs in the room are fine).
- Any form of communication with other humans, terrestrial or extraterrestrial is not allowed (Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Terminal, Signal, iMessage, SMS, MMS, etcâ€¦)
- The test is open-book, open-notes, open-web, open-IDE (e.g. VSCode) EXCEPT websites that help you cheat such as ChatGPT, BingAI, Chegg, Course Hero, Slader and - other similar websites that have tutors answering questions you upload (Stack Overflow and W3Schools are permissible).
- Copying the question text and googling/using BingAI IS CHEATING
- Posting the question text and asking someone to solve it for you IS CHEATING
- Using google to search for concepts is NOT cheating (note: using Bing search is same as using a website to cheat [due to the integrated AI/ChatGPT] and therefore WILL be considered cheating).
- If you come across the same or similar question on google, resist the temptation to keep reading, and close your browser tab.
- Do NOT share exam questions with anyone - that IS CHEATING
