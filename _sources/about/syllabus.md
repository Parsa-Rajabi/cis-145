### Course Attendance Policy

Attendance is a vital component of this course and is directly linked to your participation grade. Students are expected to attend every lecture to fully engage with the course material and contribute to class discussions. Your presence and active participation are crucial for a comprehensive learning experience.

#### Attendance Guidelines:

**Mandatory Attendance:** Regular attendance is expected for all lectures. Participation in each lecture contributes to your overall participation grade.

**Allowance for Absences:** Recognizing the need for flexibility, each student is permitted to miss up to four lectures during the course without impacting their participation grade. These absences do not require justification and are intended to accommodate unforeseen circumstances, such as illness or personal emergencies.

**Exceeding Absence Limit:** If a student misses more than 4 lectures, they will receive a score of 0 for the participation component of their grade. This policy is in place to ensure fairness and to emphasize the importance of consistent attendance.

**Responsibility to Catch Up:** Students who miss a lecture are responsible for obtaining the missed material and notes from their peers or the course resources. It is advisable to stay informed about what was covered during the absence to keep up with the course progression.

**Communication of Absences:** While the four allowed absences do not require formal notification, I encourage students to communicate any extended absences or special circumstances to the instructor as soon as possible.

**Special Considerations:** Exceptions to this policy may be considered on a case-by-case basis for serious and documented reasons, such as medical emergencies or significant personal issues. Students seeking an exception should contact the instructor directly with relevant documentation to discuss their situation.

## Late Policy and Missed Assignments/Exams

All course elements (including but limited to) assignments, quizzes, weekly activities and exams are required to be submitted or completed by the specified due dates. Inability to adhere to these deadlines will lead to a score of zero, unless exceptional situations are considered on an individual basis, subject to the approval of the instructor and supported by legitimate documentation.

## Academic Integrity

Academic Integrity is important to me and I know it is to most students. Cheating is never worth the risk to your personal and professional reputation. I expect students to be truthful and honest in their work. This means that any work you submit for individual evaluation should be yours alone and that you recognize the work of others if you use their ideas, thoughts or material. The assignments have been designed to ensure that you learn the material. I ensure that all students are graded fairly and will take action against students who violate the academic dishonesty policy. Students who engage in any acts of falsification, misrepresentation, or deception will face penalties for violating UFV policy, which can include failure in the assignment and/or a FD-Failed for Discipline grade on your transcript. Listed below are some examples of academic dishonest behavior that will result in a grade penalty:

### Plagiarism

This refers to passing off the work of another as your own. Make sure to cite all your sources if you incorporate the words or ideas of another person. This includes sources from books, journals, the internet, emails, live presentations (e.g. speeches) and even relevant conversations with other people. You can avoid plagiarism by appropriate citation and referencing in your papers, projects and presentations.

### Inappropriate use of technology in coursework

The use of technology to produce content for your assignments that is not specifically listed in the syllabus as permissible is strictly prohibited. All submissions for grading must be your own work. This specifically includes a prohibition on artificial intelligence writing software such as ChatGPT and translation software as it will interfere with the learning objectives outlined for this course.

### Collusion/ Unauthorized Collaboration

You are expected to complete all assignments for this course on your own. When assigned individual work, it is unfair to collaborate and gain an unfair advantage over your classmates who complete their work on their own. Collusion includes sharing homework, quiz or test questions and answers with other students. Examples of collusion:

- Working on answers with a friend for a homework assignment or during an open book exam
- Using “tutoring websites” (e.g. Chegg.com, CourseHero) to find answers to assignment/ exam questions
- Assisting others to cheat by answering questions that are posted to a FB/ WhatsApp group
- Falsifying/ fabricating information

**Do not misrepresent yourself or your work.** The following are examples of prohibited behavior:

- Making up sources or facts
- Misrepresenting your identity by asking someone else to complete any portion of a course (i.e. make comment on a discussion board, i-clicker quiz, exam)
- Falsifying or altering any documentation required by the University, including (but not limited to) doctors note’s in order to gain an academic advantage
 
### Unauthorized use of note-sharing websites

You may come across websites that claim to help students by providing answers to test questions and encourage students to upload your instructor’s copyrighted material (e.g. lecture slides, exam questions, etc.) Sharing exam/assignment questions is strictly prohibited as this material is the intellectual property of the instructor and should not be shared in any format. Furthermore, beware of uploading your own completed assignments/essays as you could be assisting other students to cheat using your material. Assisting others to cheat is strictly prohibited in the UFV student academic integrity policy.

Note sharing sites expect their users to comply with the Honour Code of their organization. Their own policy mandates that they cooperate with an investigation of academic dishonesty. The UFV Academic Integrity Office routinely monitors these sites for evidence of cheating and will initiate discipline proceedings against students who violate the UFV Student Academic Integrity policy.

### Unauthorized use of tutors/ editors

If you plan to use a tutor/editor, be aware that any work that you submit must always be your own. An ethical tutor will always focus on explaining concepts so that you can become an independent learner. You are violating the student academic integrity policy if:

- a private tutoring company coaches you on how to complete an assignment
- you buy / sell/  swap assignment questions and answers on social media platforms like WeChat, Whatsapp, Facebook, etc.
- your use an editor (paid or unpaid) without permission of the instructor to revise, correct or alter your work
