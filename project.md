# Project

Your course project will include developing a website for a local community event page!

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a static website for a local community event page that showcases various events happening in the area and allows users to submit events to be featured on the website.

## Website Pages

The website will include the following pages: (each page should be development as a standalone HTML page)

### `Home`

The homepage should be an attractive and eye-catching page that provides an overview of the website's purpose and the different events that are taking place. It should include pictures of 3-5 past events and a brief description of each event. Note: you can come up with own past events or search your local community event page for previous events. Make sure to cite your picutres and event details (if applicable).

### `Events`

This page should include 2 tables with the following table headers:

- Event date/time
- Event location (city)
- Event name
- Short event description

One table should be named `Past Events` and the other `Upcoming Events`. Add at least 6 events to each table. Note: you can come up with own past events or search your local community event page for previous events. Make sure to cite your picutres and event details (if applicable).

The event page should have a friendly and user-friendly design and layout.

### `Submit an Event`

This page will contain a form for community users to submit events to be featured on the website. The form should have the following fields:

- Event name
- Event date
- Event time
- Event location (address)
- Short event description
- Long event description

The form should have a clear and user-friendly design and layout. The form should also be functional and should allow users to submit their event details. Note: you do not need to actually store the event details in a database (this is beyond the scope of this class). You can simply display the event details on the page after the user submits the form. Use `https://www.randyconnolly.com/tests/process.php` as action attribute for the form.

### `About`

This page will provide details about the website, its purpose, and how users can use it. It will also include information about the website's creators and why it was created. Here are the sub-headings that you should cover on this page:

- `Our Mission`: Explain the purpose of the website and its mission.
- `Our Story`: Share the story behind the creation of the website, and how it came to be.
- `Who We Are`: Introduce the team behind the website, and explain their background and expertise.
- `What We Do`: Describe the various types of community-based events that the website covers, and how it provides information about them.
- `Our Community`: Highlight the community that the website serves, and how it helps to bring people together.
- `Our Features`: Explain the various features of the website, such as search and filtering options, event submission process, and more.
- `How to Use Our Website`: Provide a brief tutorial on how to use the website, including how to find events, how to submit an event, and how to get involved in the community.
- `Our Partners`: Highlight any partnerships or collaborations with other organizations or businesses that help support the website's mission.
- `Testimonials`: Share testimonials from users of the website who have found it helpful and informative.

Make sure to include at least 3 images on this page. Note: the information provided on this page does not need to be accurate or factual. You can make up the information as you see fit. Make sure to cite your picutres and information (if applicable).

### `Contact Us`

This page should include the information required to contact the community event organizers. It should include the following information:

- Mailing address
- Email address
- Phone number
- Social Media Link

Note: For the purpose of this course project, you can use UFV's information for either campus: [Abbotsford Campus](https://www.ufv.ca/maps/abbotsford-campus/), [Chilliwack Campus](https://www.ufv.ca/maps/chilliwack-campus/). Social media links can navigate users to UFV's social media pages: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/goUFV), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/goUFV), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/goufv/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/school/university-of-the-fraser-valley_2/).

### `Terms and Conditions`

This page should include the terms and conditions of the website. Use a website similar to [Terms and Conditions Generator](https://www.termsandconditionsgenerator.com/) to generate a terms and conditions page for your website. Make sure to cite this source in your website. Note: you do not need to include a privacy policy page.

## Website Requirements

### Logo and Branding

Come up with a name for your website and create a logo for it. You can use [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) or [Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com/make/logo-maker/) to create a logo for your website. Refer to websites such as [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.ca/) and [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) for inspiration. To come up with a name for your website, you can use [Namelix](https://namelix.com/). 

The branding of your website should be pleasant and attractive. Make sure to consider accessibility when choosing your logo and color scheme. You can use [Colorable](https://colorable.jxnblk.com/) to check if your color scheme is accessible. In addition, there are many other tools available online that can help you check the accessibility of your website:

 - [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
 - [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/)

### Header

The website should have a navigation bar that allows users to switch between the different pages and access all the pages from any page. Note: the navigation bar should not include a link to the `Terms and Conditions` page. The website should also include a logo and a search bar. The logo should be a clickable link that navigates users to the `Home` page. The search bar should be a functional search bar that allows users to search for events. Note: you do not need to actually implement the search functionality. You can simply display a message that says `Search functionality is not implemented yet.`

### Footer

The website should have a consistent footer section that includes a copyright message and a simple navigation bar. The navigation bar in the footer should have a simplified design compared to the one in the header. This navigation bar should include a link to the `Terms and Conditions` page.

### Styling

All pages of the website must use the same color scheme and style to ensure consistency and uniformity. You can use [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) to generate a color scheme for your website. You can also use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to find a font that you like and use it for your website. Make sure to consider accessibility when choosing your color scheme and font (refer to the resources mentioned in class for more information).

### Responsive Design

The website should be responsive and should look good on all devices, including desktop, tablet, and mobile. You can use [Responsive Design Checker](https://responsivedesignchecker.com/) to check the responsiveness of your website. Refer to W3School for more information on [responsive design](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_responsive.asp). You can NOT use any CSS frameworks for this project (e.g. Bootstrap, Materialize, etc.). Refer to CSS concepts discussed in class such as [Grids](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) and [Flexboxes](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) to create a responsive design for your website.

## Marking Rubric

TBA

## Late Policy and Missed Assignments/Exams

All course elements (including but limited to) assignments, quizzes, weekly activities and exams are required to be submitted or completed by the specified due dates. Inability to adhere to these deadlines will lead to a score of zero, unless exceptional situations are considered on an individual basis, subject to the approval of the instructor and supported by legitimate documentation.

## Academic Integrity

Academic Integrity is important to me and I know it is to most students. Cheating is never worth the risk to your personal and professional reputation. I expect students to be truthful and honest in their work. This means that any work you submit for individual evaluation should be yours alone and that you recognize the work of others if you use their ideas, thoughts or material. The assignments have been designed to ensure that you learn the material. I ensure that all students are graded fairly and will take action against students who violate the academic dishonesty policy. Students who engage in any acts of falsification, misrepresentation, or deception will face penalties for violating UFV policy, which can include failure in the assignment and/or a FD-Failed for Discipline grade on your transcript. Listed below are some examples of academic dishonest behavior that will result in a grade penalty:

### Plagiarism

This refers to passing off the work of another as your own. Make sure to cite all your sources if you incorporate the words or ideas of another person. This includes sources from books, journals, the internet, emails, live presentations (e.g. speeches) and even relevant conversations with other people. You can avoid plagiarism by appropriate citation and referencing in your papers, projects and presentations.

### Inappropriate use of technology in coursework

The use of technology to produce content for your assignments/quizzes that is not specifically listed in the syllabus as permissible is strictly prohibited. All submissions for grading must be your own work. This specifically includes a prohibition on artificial intelligence writing software such as ChatGPT and translation software as it will interfere with the learning objectives outlined for this course.

###  Collusion/ Unauthorized Collaboration

You are expected to complete all assignments for this course on your own. When assigned individual work, it is unfair to collaborate and gain an unfair advantage over your classmates who complete their work on their own. Collusion includes sharing homework, quiz or test questions and answers with other students. Examples of collusion:

Working on answers with a friend for a homework assignment/project or during an open book exam
Using “tutoring websites” (e.g. Chegg.com, CourseHero) to find answers to assignment/exam questions
Assisting others to cheat by answering questions that are posted to FB/WhatsApp/etc. Groups
Falsifying/ fabricating information

**Do not misrepresent yourself or your work.** The following are examples of prohibited behavior:
Making up sources or facts
Misrepresenting your identity by asking someone else to complete any portion of a course (i.e. make comment on a discussion board, i-clicker quiz, exam)
Falsifying or altering any documentation required by the University, including (but not limited to) doctors note’s in order to gain an academic advantage
 
### Unauthorized use of note-sharing websites

You may come across websites that claim to help students by providing answers to test questions and encourage students to upload your instructor’s copyrighted material (e.g. lecture slides, exam questions, etc.) Sharing exam/assignment questions is strictly prohibited as this material is the intellectual property of the instructor and should not be shared in any format. Furthermore, beware of uploading your own completed assignments/essays as you could be assisting other students to cheat using your material. Assisting others to cheat is strictly prohibited in the UFV student academic integrity policy.

Note sharing sites expect their users to comply with the Honour Code of their organization. Their own policy mandates that they cooperate with an investigation of academic dishonesty. The UFV Academic Integrity Office routinely monitors these sites for evidence of cheating and will initiate disciplinary proceedings against students who violate the UFV Student Academic Integrity policy.
