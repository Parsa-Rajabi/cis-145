```{tip}
All course elements (inlcuding but limited to) assignments, quizzes, weekly activities and exams are required to be submitted or completed by the specified due dates. Inability to adhere to these deadlines will lead to a score of zero, unless exceptional situations are considered on an individual basis, subject to the approval of the instructor and supported by legitimate documentation.
```

## About
Weekly activities are intended as exercises for you to review the lecture content and keep up with the material on a regular basis. 

As part of your weekly activities you will go over the topic that we covered in class and write 4 questions with answers. Some of your questions could appear on your exam(s).

You will create 4 questions/answers total for each lecture, 1 of each type:

1. True/False
2. Multiple Choice (4 options)
3. Short Answer (Answer should be 1-3 sentences)
4. Long Answer (Answer should be 4-8 sentences)

`Note: For T/F and MC questions, you will be required to provide the answer and an explanation as to why that is the answer.`

You will be graded on both completion and quality of your questions:

- Each week, this portion of your weekly activity will be marked out of 5 marks
    - [0.5 for question, 0.5 for answer/explanation + reference] per question type x4 = [4 marks]
    - [0.25 mark] for each question quality x4 = [1 mark]

```{warning}
Forms open at 10pm after lecture and are due at 6pm before the following lecture.
